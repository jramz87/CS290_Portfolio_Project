> **Note:** This project was developed with styling constraints as part of academic requirements. Only vanilla CSS was permitted (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, or other CSS frameworks), which influenced the visual design.

## üåê Live Demo

[Exercise Tracker App](https://exercise-tracker-frontend-dur0.onrender.com/)

> **Note:** This application is hosted on Render's free tier, which puts applications to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. When you first connect to the application after this idle period, there will be a delay of approximately 2-3 minutes as the server "wakes up" and retrieves data from MongoDB Atlas. Once awakened, the application will perform normally until it goes back to sleep after another period of inactivity.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Create**: Add new exercises with details including name, reps, weight, unit of measurement, and date
- **Read**: View all exercises in a table format
- **Update**: Edit existing exercise details
- **Delete**: Remove exercises from the database
